# Game Descirption: 
# You are starting a landscaping business, but all you have are your teeth.
# Using just your teeth, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $1. You can do this as much as you want.

# -At any point, if you are currently using your teeth, you can buy a pair of rusty scissors for $5. You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

# -Using the rusty scissors, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $5. You can do this as much as you want.

# -At any point, if you are currently using rusty scissors, you can buy an old-timey push lawnmower for $25. You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

# -Using the old-timey push lawnmower, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $50. You can do this as much as you want

# -At any point, if you are currently using the old-timey push lawnmower, you can buy a fancy battery-powered lawnmower for $250. You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

# -Using the the fancy battery-powered lawnmower, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $100. You can do this as much as you want.

# -At any point, if you are currently using the fancy battery-powered lawnmower, you can hire a team of starving students for $500. You can do this once, assuming you have enough money.

# -Using the the team of starving students, you can spend the day cutting lawns and make $250. You can do this as much as you want.

# -You win the game when you have a team of starving students and $1000. In this situation, send a message to the user telling them, theyâ€™ve won.

# Game Flow:
# if users bank balance is below $5 -> run cutGrassTeeth
# if the users bank is above $5 then ask if they want to upgrade to scissors 
#   if yes -> run cutGrassScissors()
#   if no -> keep running cutGrassTeeth()
# if users bank is above $25 then ask if they want to upgrade to an old-timey push mower
#   if yes -> run cutGrassPushMower()
#   if no -> run current cutGrass function
# and continue for each upgrade once cash has hit certain balance.
